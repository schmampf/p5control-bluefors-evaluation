 PARAMETERS:
 **********

    trans = normal transmission coefficient: [0,1]
    temp = temperature in units of the gap at the corresponding temperature.
    wi = lower limit in the energy integration of the current (in units of the gap)
    wf = upper limit in the energy integration of the current (in units of the gap)
    vi = initial voltage (in units of the gap)
    vf = final voltage (in units of the gap)
    vstep = voltage step (in units of the gap)

 NOTES AND ADVICES:
 *****************

 0) To run the code: the code calls this input file (iv.in) to read the parameters.
    The output has a free format. Thus, you can write down the results in a new file: 
			example ----> iv.exe > iv.dat (oupt file)

 1) The output file contains two columns:

   voltage (in units of the gap)       current (normalized by 2*e*Delta/h) 

 2) This program only computes the dc current.

 3) The program estimates the number of multiple Andreev reflections, n, that one
    needs with the following condition: n = 2*Delta/voltage. Now the maximum value
    allowed for "n" is 500. This means that the minimum value allowed for "vi" is 
    more or less 0.005*Delta.

 4) For the energy integration of the current a personal integration subroutine is used. 
    The value of the absolute and relative are now Atol=(1.e-8) and Rtol=(1.e-6) (see 
    program, lines number 58-59). This should be enough, but keep it in mind.

 5) Energy integration: choose "wi" and "wf" symmetrically (see example). At least use for
    wi and wf several times the value of the maximum voltage (vf). IMPORTANT: At low 
    voltages one needs to enlarge the energy integration considerably, otherwise one gets 
    negative current.

 6) If you want to do calculations at finite temperature: Notice that all the energy scales 
    are normalized with the gap at the corresponding temperature. If you need the absolute
    value of the current, I can implement the temperature dependence of the gap.
